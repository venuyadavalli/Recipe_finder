Notes / Extras

All manually added recipes automatically have source = MANUAL.

All imported recipes from TheMealDB automatically have source = API.

Searching, filtering, and suggesting recipes all work based on the ingredients and category stored in your database.

The clear endpoints (/clear/manual & /clear/api) are useful for resetting your DB separately for manual/API data.
